# SnakeGame.cpp
This is a simple Snake game developed in C++, where the snake (represented by *) must collect food (denoted by o) within defined borders. The game begins when any of the numpad keys (2, 4, 6, or 8) are pressed. As the snake eats the food, the score updates in real-time. The game concludes when the snake collides with the borders.
